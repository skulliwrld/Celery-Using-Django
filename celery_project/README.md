# Celery Using Django
 
on this project django celery is been used to create an program for sending Email to all of our users in our database...with django celery,we are able to improve the efficiency and time for process request made by users in this application as celery handles the process,not django.
in this code,we created two main apps,and we install django-celery,django-celery-results,django-celery-beat.
